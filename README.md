# SharedInventory
When one goes down, you all go down

## Building
So very simple.
- Clone this repository
- Run `./gradlew build`

## Installing
Just drop the plugin into your server (PaperMC recommended) and you're good to go!

## What does this do?
When one player dies on your server, _everybody_ loses their inventory. If you like pain, this ones for you.
